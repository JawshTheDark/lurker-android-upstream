# Lurker for Android

A native Android client for [Lurker](https://github.com/amiantos/lurker) — Kotlin + Jetpack Compose,
built to feel like a modern messaging app rather than a terminal. It talks to a Lurker bouncer server
over its WebSocket + REST contract, and it also ships a **standalone direct-IRC mode** so it works
even without a Lurker server at all.

> **Status: release-candidate.** What began as a spike to prove Lurker's bearer-token contract could
> drive a native client has grown into a daily driver: signed-in persistence, resilient reconnect,
> formatted chat, member lists, uploads, search, DCC, notifications, and a full second backend that
> speaks raw IRC and bouncers. Actively used against production servers and the hosted app, and
> released often — see [Releases](https://github.com/JawshTheDark/lurker-android-upstream/releases)
> for the APK and the running changelog.

## Two ways to run it

**Lurker mode** — connect to a Lurker server, which stays connected to IRC for you (a true bouncer:
the client never touches IRC; the server does parsing, TLS, SASL, reconnect, history, highlight
matching, and ignore filtering). Works with:

- **Hosted [lurker.chat](https://lurker.chat)** — sign in with your email; the token is minted at the
  control plane and all traffic is proxied to your cell transparently.
- **Self-hosted Lurker** — sign in with your username and password against your own server.

**Direct mode** — a standalone IRC client with no Lurker server required. Powered by
[KICL](https://github.com/KittehOrg/KittehIRCClientLib) (Netty, IRCv3), it connects **straight to IRC
networks** or to a **bouncer** (soju / ZNC). SASL, multi-network, cap negotiation, and auto-reconnect
are all handled on-device; secrets are encrypted at rest. Connecting to a bouncer gets much of the
always-on benefit back, since the bouncer stays connected upstream. First-class support for soju's
`bouncer-networks` means one login can surface all your upstream networks as separate entries.

Pick the mode on first launch; it can be switched later from Settings.

## Features

- **Stays signed in.** The session is saved to app-private storage and reconnects silently on launch.
  Optional biometric / device-credential locks (see [Security notes](#security-notes)).
- **Resilient.** Auto-reconnect with backoff; on return from background it resumes with `?since=` so
  nothing is missed. Conversations closed on another client are reconciled away on reconnect, and an
  optional foreground service holds the connection open for reliable notifications.
- **Reads like a chat app.** iMessage-style bubbles with sender grouping, mIRC color + formatting
  (bold / italic / underline / mono), tappable links, and inline system lines for joins, parts,
  quits, nick changes, kicks, modes, and topics. Or flip to **compact mode** — dense
  `time · nick · message` rows — globally or per channel. Layouts hold together at the system's
  largest font sizes.
- **Make it yours.** Light / Dark / OLED themes, an accent colour (presets or a full HSV picker),
  chat typeface, message density, optional nick colouring, a 24-hour clock, and a chat background
  image — set globally or **per channel**.
- **Inline media.** Images, GIFs, and video embed in the timeline with a built-in viewer.
- **Multi-channel.** Opt any set of channels into one merged, pinned firehose — bubbles or compact,
  every line tagged `network · channel · nick`, and tapping one jumps straight to that message in
  its real channel.
- **Buffer list that scales.** Grouped by network, DMs after channels, active buffers floated up,
  unread + highlight badges, pins, and mark-all-read. Unread queries get their own section at the
  top so a new DM can't hide down the list. Secure (E2E) buffers show a lock.
- **Mentions.** Highlighted messages get a gold bubble (colour configurable), and tapping a
  notification opens the channel and jumps to the exact message. Notifications are actionable —
  reply, mark read, or mute — including from a paired Wear OS watch.
- **Members.** Full member list with op/voice prefixes and per-nick actions (query, whois, op, kick,
  ban, notes…). Long-press any message to whois its sender; tap a `#channel` in any message to be
  offered the join.
- **Composer.** Formatting toolbar + colour picker, tab-completion for nicks and commands, typing
  indicators, swipe-to-reply, and image/file uploads (plus Android share-sheet targets). Oversized
  files are refused up front against the ceiling the server advertises, rather than after the upload.
- **Nothing sent is lost.** A message that can't go out — offline, mid-reconnect, rejected, or
  unacknowledged — is kept in place with **Resend / Edit / Discard** instead of vanishing.
- **Slash-commands.** `/me`, `/msg`, `/query`, `/join`, `/part`, `/nick`, `/topic`, `/kick`, `/mode`,
  `/op`, `/ban`, `/whois`, `/away`, `/ctcp`, `/list`, `/raw`, … (`/help` lists them). `//` sends a
  literal leading slash.
- **Channel browser.** `/list` opens a searchable, sortable channel directory that streams results
  live as the server's `LIST` completes.
- **Search & contacts.** Server-side message search, highlights, and bookmarks. Friends carry
  multiple per-network identities and show presence on each — green online, yellow away, red
  offline, grey unknown.
- **DCC.** Receive **and** send file transfers, plus DCC chat, with live progress.
- **Settings.** A registry-driven editor over the server's settings surface — every advertised
  setting is editable by type — alongside device-local app preferences. Includes an in-app
  diagnostics log (connection + error history) to paste into a bug report.

## Flavors

One codebase, two identities (Gradle product flavors):

- **`full`** — `net.amiantos.lurker`, "Lurker" — the private daily-driver / sideload build.
- **`spooky`** — `chat.irc.lurker`, "Spooky for Lurker" — the public Play Store build.

Fork-only surfaces (custom aliases, DCC send/chat, fserve) are gated at **runtime** on the connected
server's capabilities, so both flavors carry all the code and simply light those up on a capable
server — there's no stripped branch to maintain.

## Building

```bash
# Debug (full flavor)
./gradlew assembleFullDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/full/debug/app-full-debug.apk

# Release APK (sideload) / Play bundle
./gradlew assembleFullRelease
./gradlew bundleSpookyRelease
```

Release signing for the Play build reads a gitignored `keystore.properties`; absent it (fresh clone),
release falls back to debug signing so the build still succeeds.

To sign in, point it at your server: the hosted app is `lurker.chat` (email login), a self-hosted
server is its address (username login — use the **API** port, `8010` by default, not the web dev
port). From the emulator the host machine is `10.0.2.2`, not `localhost`. Cleartext HTTP is permitted
for local dev servers.

## Security notes

- **Sessions** live in app-private storage, unreadable by other apps on a non-rooted device.
- **Direct-mode IRC/SASL secrets** are encrypted at rest via `EncryptedSharedPreferences` — direct
  mode stores real IRC account passwords, so these are kept out of cleartext.
- **Locks.** Optional biometric / device-credential gates on opening the app and on opening an
  encrypted (E2E) channel. Changing either one requires an unlock **in both directions**, so a lock
  can't be switched off by a stray tap; the confirmation fails closed.
- **Encrypted channels set `FLAG_SECURE`** while on screen — no screenshots, no screen recording,
  and no content in the recents thumbnail.

## Architecture

The UI talks to one observable backend. The base
[`LurkerClient`](app/src/main/java/net/amiantos/lurker/LurkerClient.kt) drives the WebSocket + REST
transport to a Lurker server; `DirectIrcBackend` subclasses it and overrides the transport with a
KICL-backed raw-IRC / bouncer engine, reusing the same Compose state and rendering. Pure,
unit-tested logic — mIRC parsing, command parsing, completion — is split into
[`Mirc.kt`](app/src/main/java/net/amiantos/lurker/Mirc.kt),
[`Commands.kt`](app/src/main/java/net/amiantos/lurker/Commands.kt), and friends; the screens live in
[`MainActivity.kt`](app/src/main/java/net/amiantos/lurker/MainActivity.kt).
